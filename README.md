# iris_flower_classification

## 📌 Objective
Build a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species using Random Forest Classifier.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib
- scikit-learn (Random Forest)

## 📁 Dataset
- IRIS.csv: Includes sepal/petal length and width, with species label.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install requirements using:
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
3. Run each cell step-by-step to visualize, preprocess, and train the model.

## 📊 Model Evaluation
- Random Forest Classifier achieved high accuracy on test data.
- Confusion Matrix and Classification Report included.

## 📌 Outcome
Identified the most significant features (e.g., petal length) affecting classification.
